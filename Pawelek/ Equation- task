Problem: Find solutions for given equations. 
Write all whole solutions that solves this equation:
a) (a*a + b*b) / (a*b + 1)

Input: 
The input contains two positive integer numbers in the first line: a and b  (1 ≤  a, b ≤ 100).
Output:
Print all pairs of numbers in following pattern (for n solutions)
(a1, b1)
(a2, b2)
...
(an, bn)
